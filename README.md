# sublime-makensis

Improved [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) build system to compile NSIS scripts, supporting Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

## Installation

### Package Control

1. Make sure you already have [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/) installed
2. Choose *Install Package* from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `⇧⌘P` on OS X)
3. Select *makensis* and press `Enter`

With [auto_upgrade](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/settings/) enabled, Package Control will keep all installed packages up-to-date!

### GitHub

1. Change to your Sublime Text `Packages` directory
2. Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/idleberg/sublime-makensis.git makensis`

## Usage

On Unix systems, you might have to `chmod +x makensis.sh` before you can build. When using the [NSIS](https://github.com/SublimeText/NSIS) package, you will have to switch the default build system to makensis before you can build with the default shortcut <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd>.
