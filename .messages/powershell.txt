PowerShell Build Script
=======================

With Microsoft slowly retiring the Windows Command Prompt in favour of
PowerShell, this package now includes an option to build NSIS scripts using
a PowerShell script. Over the course of the next months, or even years, this
script is meant to become the default build option of Windows.

    In an effort to bring the best command line experiences to the forefront
    for all power users, PowerShell is now the defacto command shell from File
    Explorer. It replaces Command Prompt (aka, “cmd.exe”) in the WIN + X menu,
    in File Explorer’s File menu, and in the context menu that appears when you
    shift-right-click the whitespace in File Explorer.
