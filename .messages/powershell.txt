PowerShell Build Script
=======================

As of today (January 9th, 2018), Windows 8 has reached end of mainstream
support. It has been the first Windows version to ship with PowerShell v3, the
version required by this package's script to detect the NSIS installation path
on Windows. Microsoft has announced in November 2016 to slowly deprecate the
Windows Command Prompt in favour of PowerShell, so the new default build
variant on Windows is now following that direction, replacing the old Batch
script.

In all likelihood, building NSIS script will continue to work as it always has!

If you wish to continue using the old Batch script, for whatever reason, please
select the “Legacy Windows” build variant from the Tools menu.
