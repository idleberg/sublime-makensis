PowerShell Build Script
=======================

With Microsoft slowly retiring the Windows Command Prompt ("cmd.exe") in favour
of PowerShell, this package now includes an option to build NSIS scripts using
a PowerShell script. Over the course of the next months, if not years, this
script is meant to become the new default build option of Windows.

If you run into any problems using this script, please report an issue on the
GitHub repository:
