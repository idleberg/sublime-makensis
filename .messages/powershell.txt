PowerShell Build Script
=======================

With Microsoft slowly retiring the Windows Command Prompt in favour of
PowerShell, this package now includes an option to build NSIS scripts using
a PowerShell script. Over the course of the next months, or even years, this
script is meant to become the default build option of Windows.

If you run into any problems using this script, please report an issue on the
GitHub repository:
